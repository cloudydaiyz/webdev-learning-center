Hello! ðŸ‘‹ 

This repository serves as a learning hub as I complete technical projects to reinforce my learning of web development, while also building my portfolio. Currently, I'm prioritizing creating full stack applications (focusing on the frontend) in order to help develop my knowledge on creating high-quality, responsive web designs.

For more context on the projects that I'm creating, navigate to the directories of each individual project! 

Skills used: HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js, Typescript
