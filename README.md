Hello! ðŸ‘‹ 

This repository serves as a learning hub as I complete technical projects to reinforce my learning of web development. Currently, I'm prioritizing creating full stack applications (focusing on the frontend) in order to help develop my knowledge on creating nice, responsive web designs.

If you want to get more context on the projects that I'm creating, navigate to the directories of each individual project. 

Skills used: HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js
