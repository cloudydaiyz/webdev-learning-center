This project was created following [Frontend Web Development: In Depth (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsnQ5uepIaE) by freeCodeCamp.

`vanilla` contains the code for the pure HTML, CSS, and JS version of the project

`vanilla-mvc` contains the code for the pure HTML, CSS, and JS version of the project, but refactored using ES6 modules and the MVC paradigm with JS

`typescript` contains the code for the Typescript refactor of the project

## Overview
This project is a game of tic tac toe, created using 3 different times -- once using vanilla JS, another using vanilla JS with the MVC pattern, and lastly using Typescript. 

## Purpose of completion
The purpose of completing this project was to go through the full workflow of creating a fully functional app in HTML, CSS, and JS. It also ended up helping me gain experience refactoring frontend code for better design patterns after having to refactor it twice. Even though I've created a project previously in Typescript, I've never refactored vanilla JS code into Typescript code, and it ended up being easier than I thought it'd be.

## Challenges encountered
I experienced some trouble in the beginning getting my layout correct on desktop. Even though the video used a CSS reset, I ended up removing some of my CSS reset since the box-border property caused some of my DOM elements to be improperly positioned on the page. Other than that, there weren't too many other challenges with this project; mainly lots of new insights.

## Next steps
- Refactor the project using React
- Add a backend to the app for a multiplayer mode
