From [Frontend Web Development: In Depth (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsnQ5uepIaE) by freeCodeCamp.

`vanilla` - Pure HTML / CSS / JS
`vanilla-mvc` - Pure HTML / CSS / JS, but refactored using ES6 modules and the MVC paradigm with JS
`typescript` - Typescript refactor

Ended up not doing the React portion of the video since the setup part was outdated, but I may revisit this in the future.
