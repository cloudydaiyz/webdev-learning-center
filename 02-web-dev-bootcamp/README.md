These projects were created following [Frontend Web Development Bootcamp Course (JavaScript, HTML, CSS)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJSY8tbf_ys) by freeCodeCamp.

`html-mini-challenge` contains the code for my initial attempt at the [HTML + JavaScript "Meme Generator" challenge](https://youtu.be/zJSY8tbf_ys?si=8lUzbBFS-WnZNkxL&t=44637).

`pricing-card` contains the code for the [Frontend Mentor CSS "Pricing Card" challenge](https://youtu.be/zJSY8tbf_ys?si=hBTnfpLOAYP-vt4_&t=56631).

`testimonials-grid-section` contains the code for the [Frontend Mentor CSS Flexbox "Testimonials" challenge](https://youtu.be/zJSY8tbf_ys?si=yzjhi_f7TgK9UITs&t=70845).

## Overview
These collection of projects are a series of different static websites created using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The `html-mini-challenge` is a meme generator that contains the options to show a meme, quote, joke, or riddle with its respective answer. The `pricing-card` is a sample pricing card project for a fake brand as a solution to Frontend Mentor's [Single price grid component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/single-price-grid-component-5ce41129d0ff452fec5abbbc/hub) challenge, mainly using CSS flexbox. Finally, the `testimonials-grid-section` is a sample testimonials section for a fake website as a solution to Frontend Mentor's [Testimonials grid section](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/testimonials-grid-section-Nnw6J7Un7/hub) challenge, also using CSS flexbox.

## Purpose of completion
The purpose of completing these projects was to refine my skills in HTML, CSS, and JS fundamentals. These projects, especially the Frontend Mentor ones, allowed me to see what it was like going from a starting design to a final product, building my confidence to approach more simple designs in the future. Even though they look somewhat professional, they turned out to be not that hard to make whenever I found the right tooling.

## Challenges encountered
I didn't experience too many errors whenever I created these projects, since I mostly followed along with the videos. It was a bit difficult to get my initial attempt at the `html-mini-challenge` to match what the video had, though it was the first project that I did.

## Next items
If I come back to these projects in the future, some additional things I'd want to add are:
- Redo my `htm-mini-challenge`
- Redo the `testimonials-grid-section` using CSS grid
- Add CSS animations to the Frontend Mentor challenges
