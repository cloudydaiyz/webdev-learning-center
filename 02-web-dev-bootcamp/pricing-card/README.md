## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learned about the general workflow of going from a design to a finished product in HTML/CSS/JS. The "toughest" part was creating the inital layout of HTML elements across the page.

### Continued development

If I were to continue this project in the future, some things I would add are:
- CSS Grid layout
- CSS animations for the button

### Useful resources

- [Frontend Web Development Bootcamp Course (JavaScript, HTML, CSS)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJSY8tbf_ys) - This is a great course for frontend development that goes over the basic principles of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and provides an implementation for this project.
