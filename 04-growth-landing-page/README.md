This project was created for the Growth website Landing page from iCodeThis challenge.

## Overview
This project is a responsive landing page for a fake company called Growth. It was made using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS, and only contains functionality for components.

## Purpose of completion
The purpose of completing this project was to go through the full workflow of creating a website in HTML, CSS, and JS without following a tutorial. It allowed me to find my own workflow for completing the project, based on the principles of frontend development I developed by completing previous projects.

## Challenges encountered
The main challenge I had doing this project was during the beginning. Even though I was used to creating frontend projects by now because of the tutorials I followed, I wasn't completely sure on how I should begin, especially with the styles. I wanted my CSS code to be concise in the beginning, so if certain properties were being repeated among certain elements, I wanted to catch them as I was initially styling the page rather than when I was refactoring. Whenever I cared a bit less about doing this for my intial styling, the project became faster and more entertaining to work on.

## Lessons Learned
Some of the things I learned while completing this project includes:
- You don’t have to do mobile-first. If doing desktop-first is better for you, then go ahead.
- Although it’s helpful to have media queries generalized for each device type, it’s not required. If it makes sense for an element to have its own query, just use it.
- Be more specific to select the item you want!
- There is no justify-self for Flexbox
- Even though I learned tons good web design concepts, I did feel like some parts were being overengineered a bit.

## Next steps
If I were to continue this project, some things I would do would be:
- Refactor the project, making the CSS more concise
- Adding additional pages to the website
- Adding more transitions when hovering over certain divs (e.g. testimonials)
- Ensuring all functionality on the page works
